.SH DESCRIPTION
.B _printf
It is a function that produces output according to a format. The format string is composed of zero or more directives.

.SH FORMAT
controls the output as in C printf. Interpreted sequences are:
.TP
.B %%
a single %

.SH CONVERSION SPECIFIERS
.B  A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied.  The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
.TP
.B \-d
The  int  argument  is  converted to signed decimal notation(base10).  The precision, if any, gives the minimum number of digits that must appear

.TP
.B \-i
The  int  argument  is  converted to signed decimal notation.  The precision, if any, gives the minimum number of digits that must appear

.TP
.B \-s
a pointer to an array of character  type  (pointer  to a string).  Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\0');

.TP
.B \-c
a pointer to an array of character  type  (pointer  to a string).  Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\0');

.TP
.B \-o, u, x, X
The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned octal (o), unsigned decimal (u), or  unsigned  hexadecimal (x and X) notation.  The letters abcdef are used for x conversions; the letters ABCDEF are used for X conversions.  The precision, if any, gives the minimum number of digits that must appear; if  the converted  value  requires fewer digits, it is padded on the left with zeros.  The default precision is 1.  When 0 is printed with an explicit precision 0, the output is empty.

.TP
.B \-s
a pointer to an array of character  type  (pointer  to a string).  Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\0'), Non printable characters (0 < ASCII value < 32 or >= 127) are printed this way: \x, followed by the ASCII code value in hexadecimal;
